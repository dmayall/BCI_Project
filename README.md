# BCI_Project
Hi my name is Derrick Mayall and I am a Data Science student at UNCC. I have a lot of code that is mostly working in Python with big data from my research that I have posted in thsi repository. Most if not all of the research code cannot be run by anyone who is not involved in the research and has access to the repository but I will provide all outputs and pickled data so that some parts of it can be ran by anyone who desires. This project was seeing how dimesnionality reduction cna be used on BCI data to take the 100+ dimensional data we have and producing a 2D and 3D representation of what is going on in the brain. Me and another student actually got to gather our own data and use it for the research so it was interesting to see the results.
