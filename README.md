# BCI_Project
This project was an introduction into dimensionality reduction for myself. The goal of this project was to take the high dimensional BCI data (1000+ dimensions) and make it graphable for quick and easy analysis. I made 2D and 3D graphs useing different dimensionality reduction techniques such as TSNE and PacMap. With this we could analyze the differences among the participants whom data we were using (One of which was my own brain signals and another student). Further research is needed to understand the differences and why tehy occur but we did notice promising results wehn reducing this data dimensionaly so it could be readable.
